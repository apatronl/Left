Toast-Swift
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scalessec/Toast-Swift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scalessec/Toast-Swift)
[![CocoaPods Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/Toast-Swift.svg)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/Toast-Swift)

Toast-Swift is a Swift extension that adds toast notifications to the `UIView` object class. It is intended to be simple, lightweight, and easy to use. Most toast notifications can be triggered with a single line of code.

**Toast-Swift is a native Swift port of [Toast for iOS](https://github.com/scalessec/Toast "Toast for iOS").**

Basic Examples
---------
```swift
// basic usage
self.view.makeToast("This is a piece of toast")

// toast with a specific duration and position
self.view.makeToast("This is a piece of toast", duration: 3.0, position: .Top)

// toast with all possible options
self.view.makeToast("This is a piece of toast", duration: 2.0, position: CGPoint(x: 110.0, y: 110.0), title: "Toast Title", image: UIImage(named: "toast.png"), style:nil) { (didTap: Bool) -> Void in
    if didTap {
        print("completion from tap")
    } else {
        print("completion without tap")
    }
}
                
// display toast with an activity spinner
self.view.makeToastActivity(.Center)

// display any view as toast
self.view.showToast(myView)
```

But wait, there's more!
---------
```swift
// create a new style
var style = ToastStyle()

// this is just one of many style options
style.messageColor = UIColor.blueColor()

// present the toast with the new style
self.view.makeToast("This is a piece of toast", duration: 3.0, position: .Bottom, style: style)

// or perhaps you want to use this style for all toasts going forward?
// just set the shared style and there's no need to provide the style again
ToastManager.shared.style = style

// toggle "tap to dismiss" functionality
ToastManager.shared.tapToDismissEnabled = true

// toggle queueing behavior
ToastManager.shared.queueEnabled = true
```
    
See the demo project for more examples.
